They are the most eccentric of any in the cycle. They don't like to borrow money, or to make complimentary or flowery speeches. Yet they are sincere in what they say, and their opinions are valid. They are capable of doing good work and devoting themselves to good works. But they can be just as strong in devoting themselves to evil. They are quite softhearted and are taken in by any sort of line. This gives other people tremendous advantage over them. Dragon people worry a great deal, and for no good reason.

They are selfish and just a bit stingy when they are approached for a loan. Yet people born in the snake year have tremendous sympathy for others and will try to help them, much to the annoyance of those they are helping, since snake-year people habitually overdo anything they do. This cannot be helped because snake people have doubts about other people's judgment and prefer to rely on their own accumulated wisdom. They are very determined in what they do and hate to fail at anything, and although they are calm by nature, they are most intense; if they shoot an arrow at a target, they must hit that target.

A compliment to a Japanese woman is to tell her that she is a mi-bijin, which means a snake-year beauty.

It would be wise to avoid an ox-year person when he is angry, for he is likely to do something rash to anyone confronting him. Ox-year people are mentally alert, and although they are not prone to speaking much, when required to speak they can be eloquent.

For all their placid and easygoing ways, they are remarkably stubborn, and they hate to fail at anything they do. If they are opposed when they want to work on a project they favor, their patience may wear thin, and they can be quite unpleasant. Ox-year people regard affection between men and women as a sort of game they cannot understand, and this rather cool attitude causes their families to have difficulties with them over emotional matters.

Yet people born in the snake year have tremendous sympathy for others and will try to help them, much to the annoyance of those they are helping, since snake-year people habitually overdo anything they do. This cannot be helped because snake people have doubts about other people's judgment and prefer to rely on their own accumulated wisdom.

Boar-year people don't talk much, but when they finally say something, they let it all come out at one time, and there is no shutting them up until they have finished. Like monkey-year people, they have a great thirst for knowledge. They study a great deal and on the surface are generally well informed. However, if a boar person's knowledge is probed, it will be discovered that what he knows is limited. The Japanese saying is that such a person is broad in front but has a narrow back. Boar people are quite short-tempered, yet they hate quarreling or arguments. They are affectionate and kind to their loved ones. Boar people will have marital problems, and during the first and second phases of their lives they will have difficulties. Yet no matter how difficult their problems may be, boar people are shy and will not ask for outside help hut will seek solutions to their problems by themselves. Boar people are advised not to get into lawsuits, for, being impulsive and honest, they will lose the suit to someone who is unscrupulous. Rabbit and sheep people make the best spouses for those born in the year of the boar. The next best choice of a spouse would be any of those born in the rat, ox, tiger, dragon, horse, rooster, or dog year.

NULL,Water Rat,Rat,"Charming, appealing, clever. Quick-witted and sociable. Hoarders and wasters.","PEOPLE born in the year of the rat are noted for their charm. However, they are fussy about small matters and have a tendency to pinch pennies. When such people want something very much, they will work hard for the thing desired. Because they are thrifty, they are able to save a great deal of money. Unfortunately, they may lose what they have saved by spending it on someone they love who does not love them. Curiously enough, only through love does a person born in this year become generous. Although people born in this year can maintain an outward show of control, they are easily angered. Their value lies in the fact that they are able to control their discontent or anger. Small-minded as these people are, they are quite honest and ambitious and have a tremendous capacity for pursuing a course to its end. They love to spend money on themselves, denying themselves nothing, but they don't lend. They love to gossip, and because of this characteristic they are apt to have short-term friends. They will have good fortune in the first phase of their life. But in the second phase they will lose everything they have at one time through a mistakenly taken chance or a shattering love affair. Yet in the latter part of their life they will live well and comfortably. A person born in the year of the rat would do well to marry someone born in either the dragon, the monkey, or the ox year, for people of these years are temperamentally suited to those of the rat year. The next best choice would be one born in the year of the rat, tiger, snake, dog, or boar. The worst would be with one born in the horse year, and it would be doubly disastrous for a rat-year man to marry a woman born in the year called the ""fire horse year,"" which comes every sixty years. A popular superstition claims that a man marrying such a woman does not live out his full span of life.",Yang,1,49,Sagittarius,https://placehold.jp/150x150.png,5,1972/15/2,1973/2/2,2032/11/02,2033/30/01
NULL,Water Ox,Ox,"Methodical, routine. Dependable, sullen. Dislikes competition.","PEOPLE born in the year of the ox are very patient and speak little. They have a gift for inspiring confidence in others, and this allows them to achieve a great deal of success. They are, however, eccentric and terribly bigoted. If people dislike them, it is for this reason only. For all their patience and reticence, there is a paradoxical quality to their temperament; they anger easily and they show it. It would be wise to avoid an ox-year person when he is angry, for he is likely to do something rash to anyone confronting him. Ox-year people are mentally alert, and although they are not prone to speaking much, when required to speak they can be eloquent. They are dexterous to the point of genius and can do all sorts of things with their hands. For all their placid and easygoing ways, they are remarkably stubborn, and they hate to fail at anything they do. If they are opposed when they want to work on a project they favor, their patience may wear thin, and they can be quite unpleasant. Ox-year people regard affection between men and women as a sort of game they cannot understand, and this rather cool attitude causes their families to have difficulties with them over emotional matters. The first phase of their life will be generally happy. The second phase will not be good; family or marital difficulties will occur, and for that period ox people will lose the respect of those who once admired them. But in their third phase of their life, whatever rough edges there might have been will be smoothed out. Marriage for people born in the ox year is rather peculiar. The best marriages would be with persons born in either the snake year, the rooster year, or the rat year; the next best, with those born in the ox, dragon, rabbit, monkey, or boar year. An ox-year person would have a bad marriage with a person born in the horse or the dog year, and the worst possible marriage would be with anyone born in the sheep year.",Yin,2,50,Capricorn,https://placehold.jp/150x150.png,5,1973/3/2,1974/22/1,2033/31/01,2034/18/02

Proud, unrestrained.","TIGER people are sensitive, short-tempered, given to deep thinking, and capable of great sympathy for those of whom they are fond. Other people have deep respect for those born in the year of the tiger, but on occasion tiger-born people come into conflict with older people or those who have higher authority. People give tiger people much more credit for achievement than they deserve. Tiger people cannot make up their minds quickly enough and delay an important decision until it is too late to make a good one. They have somewhat narrow minds and are highly suspicious of other people and don't trust them. Although courageous and stubborn, tiger people can be selfish and just a bit mean. Yet, among Asian people, and especially the people of Japan, it is a fortuitous thing for a man to be born in the year of the tiger. The tiger, it is believed, represents the greatest terrestrial power and stands as an emblem of protection over human life. It chases away the ""three disasters"": thieves, fire, and ghosts. The first and third phases of the tiger-born person's life will be smooth and easygoing. It is the second phase that will bring the most difficulties. Unless the problems during the second phase are handled carefully, they may overlap and run into the third phase. Horse-year, dragon-year, or dog-year people make the best spouses for tiger-born people. Rat, ox, rabbit, tiger, sheep, rooster, and boar are second choices. The worst marriage for a tiger-born person would be with either a snake-year or a monkey-year person.

They are smooth talkers, talented and ambitious. Virtuous and reserved, they have exceedingly fine tastes, and other people regard them with admiration and deeply trust them. Rabbit people are always financially lucky. They have a fondness for mild gossip, but they are tactful and do not speak out willingly if they have to say something bad about someone. They are very affectionate to those they love but are curiously detached from their families, regarding the other members as little better than strangers. Rabbit people have to be goaded for quite a while before they lose their tempers, for by temperament they are placid. They are very clever at business, and if someone signs a contract with a rabbit person, there can be no backing out of it. Rabbit people are temperamentally melancholy and are able to weep at the slightest provocation. They are somewhat pedantic and not very well informed, so that, although what they know they know well, they will not seek out further information on other subjects. Rabbit people would make good gamblers, for they have the uncanny gift of picking the sure thing. They are a bit conservative and do not plunge into anything without first thinking it over carefully. Some Japanese regard rabbits with suspicion, for there is a belief that witches sometimes take the form of a rabbit. Rabbit people will have a placid existence throughout all three phases of their lives, provided they do not become involved with unmanageable elements. Rabbit people would do well to marry persons born in either the sheep, the boar, or the dog year.

These are, of course, typical attributes for the dragon-year person. However, dragon-year people are honest, sensitive, and brave and can inspire trust in almost everyone. They are the most eccentric of any in the cycle. They don't like to borrow money, or to make complimentary or flowery speeches. Yet they are sincere in what they say, and their opinions are valid. They are capable of doing good work and devoting themselves to good works. But they can be just as strong in devoting themselves to evil. They are quite softhearted and are taken in by any sort of line. This gives other people tremendous advantage over them. Dragon people worry a great deal, and for no good reason. They are not prone to marry early, and in some cases not at all. This may account for their loneliness in their old age. Yet other people love them. Dragon-born people are somewhat fastidious. This makes it rather difficult for them in the first phase of their life. During the second phase, their fortunes will be like waves, and in the final phase, they will at last have peace and contentment. Dragon people do have big mouths and, when excited, say a great deal they don't mean, but normally they are not gossipers. Men born in the dragon year are also considered fortunate, for the dragon represents the greatest celestial power and is one of the two most beneficial astrological influences. The dragon symbolizes life and growth and is said to bring the five blessings: riches, harmony, virtue, longevity, and finishing the allotted life span. The best marriage for the dragon-year person would be with a person born in the year of the rat, snake, monkey, or rooster. Next best would be one born in the tiger, horse, sheep, or boar year.

They speak very little and possess tremendous wisdom. They are unbelievably fortunate in money matters in that they never have to worry about them. They will always be able to obtain money whenever they need it. Snake-year people are quite vain and always dress up to the point of foppery. They are selfish and just a bit stingy when they are approached for a loan. Yet people born in the snake year have tremendous sympathy for others and will try to help them, much to the annoyance of those they are helping, since snake-year people habitually overdo anything they do. This cannot be helped because snake people have doubts about other people's judgment and prefer to rely on their own accumulated wisdom. They are very determined in what they do and hate to fail at anything, and although they are calm by nature, they are most intense; if they shoot an arrow at a target, they must hit that target. People born in the snake year are quite passionate and are handsome if they are men and beauties if they are women. A compliment to a Japanese woman is to tell her that she is a mi-bijin, which means a snake-year beauty. However, people born in the snake year will always have marital troubles, for snake-year spouses have affections outside of the family. If they were to confine such affection to their immediate family, their lives would be much smoother. Great care must be taken in the third phase of a snake-year person's life, for it is the last phase that is the worst. Snake-year people would be wise to marry anyone born in either the ox or the rooster year.

Horse-year people are not noted for their patience. They are hot-blooded, but in their everyday work they can be dispassionate over what they do. In their affections they are stimulated almost to the point of being blind to everything else. Horse-year people like theatrical entertainment and always go to plays and musicals, conventions, operas-almost any place where there are entertainers and large crowds. Horse people anger quickly, and by showing their anger they lose whatever confidence people may have had in them. They are terribly independent.

It is not so. For people born in the year of the sheep are shy, pessimistic, puzzled about life, and uncertain over what direction they should take. Deeply religious and timid by nature-timid to the point of a woman's timidity-they are never the world's conquerors or leaders. They are clumsy in speech and make poor salesmen, yet they are passionate in whatever they do and whatever they believe in, and not just in their affections either. Because they are uncertain about themselves and what they should do, sheep people must be guided, and in this case they will be best at the arts. Throughout their whole life, people born in the sheep year will never have problems over i-shoku-ju (having clothes, a good table, and comfortable living), for their abilities will always make money for them so that they will always be able to exercise their good taste.

Monkey-year people have a disconcerting habit of agreeing with others. They feel more comfortable when they agree, but this sort of agreement is merely a policy tactic. If a monkey-year person sets out to do something and is unable to start immediately, he becomes discouraged and abandons the project even before he has actually tried it. Monkey people have a poor opinion of other people and tend to hold them in contempt. Yet monkey people are prized for their skills, talents, and flexibility.
