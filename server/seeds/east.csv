1	Wood Rat	Charming, appealing, clever. Quick-witted and sociable. Hoarders and wasters.	"PEOPLE born in the year of the rat are noted for their charm. However, they are fussy about small matters and have a tendency to pinch pennies. When such people want something very much, they will work hard for the thing desired. Because they are thrifty, they are able to save a great deal of money. Unfortunately, they may lose what they have saved by spending it on someone they love who does not love them. Curiously enough, only through love does a person born in this year become generous. Although people born in this year can maintain an outward show of control, they are easily angered. Their value lies in the fact that they are able to control their discontent or anger. Small-minded as these people are, they are quite honest and ambitious and have a tremendous capacity for pursuing a course to its end. They love to spend money on themselves, denying themselves nothing, but they don't lend. They love to gossip, and because of this characteristic they are apt to have short-term friends. They will have good fortune in the first phase of their life. But in the second phase they will lose everything they have at one time through a mistakenly taken chance or a shattering love affair. Yet in the latter part of their life they will live well and comfortably. A person born in the year of the rat would do well to marry someone born in either the dragon, the monkey, or the ox year, for people of these years are temperamentally suited to those of the rat year. The next best choice would be one born in the year of the rat, tiger, snake, dog, or boar. The worst would be with one born in the horse year, and it would be doubly disastrous for a rat-year man to marry a woman born in the year called the ""fire horse year,"" which comes every sixty years. A popular superstition claims that a man marrying such a woman does not live out his full span of life."	Yang	1	1	Sagittarius	1	128-rat.png	Rat	1924-02-05	1925-01-24	1984-02-02	1985-02-19
2	Wood Ox	Methodical, routine. Dependable, sullen. Dislikes competition.	PEOPLE born in the year of the ox are very patient and speak little. They have a gift for inspiring confidence in others, and this allows them to achieve a great deal of success. They are, however, eccentric and terribly bigoted. If people dislike them, it is for this reason only. For all their patience and reticence, there is a paradoxical quality to their temperament; they anger easily and they show it. It would be wise to avoid an ox-year person when he is angry, for he is likely to do something rash to anyone confronting him. Ox-year people are mentally alert, and although they are not prone to speaking much, when required to speak they can be eloquent. They are dexterous to the point of genius and can do all sorts of things with their hands. For all their placid and easygoing ways, they are remarkably stubborn, and they hate to fail at anything they do. If they are opposed when they want to work on a project they favor, their patience may wear thin, and they can be quite unpleasant. Ox-year people regard affection between men and women as a sort of game they cannot understand, and this rather cool attitude causes their families to have difficulties with them over emotional matters. The first phase of their life will be generally happy. The second phase will not be good; family or marital difficulties will occur, and for that period ox people will lose the respect of those who once admired them. But in their third phase of their life, whatever rough edges there might have been will be smoothed out. Marriage for people born in the ox year is rather peculiar. The best marriages would be with persons born in either the snake year, the rooster year, or the rat year; the next best, with those born in the ox, dragon, rabbit, monkey, or boar year. An ox-year person would have a bad marriage with a person born in the horse or the dog year, and the worst possible marriage would be with anyone born in the sheep year.

3	Fire Tiger	Fiercely competitive; rash, brave, magnetic. Proud, unrestrained.	"TIGER people are sensitive, short-tempered, given to deep thinking, and capable of great sympathy for those of whom they are fond. Other people have deep respect for those born in the year of the tiger, but on occasion tiger-born people come into conflict with older people or those who have higher authority. People give tiger people much more credit for achievement than they deserve. Tiger people cannot make up their minds quickly enough and delay an important decision until it is too late to make a good one. They have somewhat narrow minds and are highly suspicious of other people and don't trust them. Although courageous and stubborn, tiger people can be selfish and just a bit mean. Yet, among Asian people, and especially the people of Japan, it is a fortuitous thing for a man to be born in the year of the tiger. The tiger, it is believed, represents the greatest terrestrial power and stands as an emblem of protection over human life. It chases away the ""three disasters"": thieves, fire, and ghosts. The first and third phases of the tiger-born person's life will be smooth and easygoing. It is the second phase that will bring the most difficulties. Unless the problems during the second phase are handled carefully, they may overlap and run into the third phase. Horse-year, dragon-year, or dog-year people make the best spouses for tiger-born people. Rat, ox, rabbit, tiger, sheep, rooster, and boar are second choices. The worst marriage for a tiger-born person would be with either a snake-year or a monkey-year person. "	Yang	3	3	Aquarius	2	128-tiger.png	Tiger	1926-02-13	1927-02-01	1986-02-09	1987-01-28
4	Fire Rabbit	Gregarious, but aloof. Avoids confrontation. Benevolent, inclined to gossip. Artistic.	PEOPLE born in the year of the rabbit are the most fortunate. They are smooth talkers, talented and ambitious. Virtuous and reserved, they have exceedingly fine tastes, and other people regard them with admiration and deeply trust them. Rabbit people are always financially lucky. They have a fondness for mild gossip, but they are tactful and do not speak out willingly if they have to say something bad about someone. They are very affectionate to those they love but are curiously detached from their families, regarding the other members as little better than strangers. Rabbit people have to be goaded for quite a while before they lose their tempers, for by temperament they are placid. They are very clever at business, and if someone signs a contract with a rabbit person, there can be no backing out of it. Rabbit people are temperamentally melancholy and are able to weep at the slightest provocation. They are somewhat pedantic and not very well informed, so that, although what they know they know well, they will not seek out further information on other subjects. Rabbit people would make good gamblers, for they have the uncanny gift of picking the sure thing. They are a bit conservative and do not plunge into anything without first thinking it over carefully. Some Japanese regard rabbits with suspicion, for there is a belief that witches sometimes take the form of a rabbit. Rabbit people will have a placid existence throughout all three phases of their lives, provided they do not become involved with unmanageable elements. Rabbit people would do well to marry persons born in either the sheep, the boar, or the dog year. A bad marriage would be with someone born in the dragon year, and the worst would be with someone from either the rat or the rooster year.

5	Earth Dragon	Exotic. vital. Elegant, fond of the occult. Decisive, but not methodical. Over-confident, transient.	DRAGON-year people are healthy and energetic and at the same time excitable, short-tempered, and terribly stubborn. These are, of course, typical attributes for the dragon-year person. However, dragon-year people are honest, sensitive, and brave and can inspire trust in almost everyone. They are the most eccentric of any in the cycle. They don't like to borrow money, or to make complimentary or flowery speeches. Yet they are sincere in what they say, and their opinions are valid. They are capable of doing good work and devoting themselves to good works. But they can be just as strong in devoting themselves to evil. They are quite softhearted and are taken in by any sort of line. This gives other people tremendous advantage over them. Dragon people worry a great deal, and for no good reason. They are not prone to marry early, and in some cases not at all. This may account for their loneliness in their old age. Yet other people love them. Dragon-born people are somewhat fastidious. This makes it rather difficult for them in the first phase of their life. During the second phase, their fortunes will be like waves, and in the final phase, they will at last have peace and contentment. Dragon people do have big mouths and, when excited, say a great deal they don't mean, but normally they are not gossipers. Men born in the dragon year are also considered fortunate, for the dragon represents the greatest celestial power and is one of the two most beneficial astrological influences. The dragon symbolizes life and growth and is said to bring the five blessings: riches, harmony, virtue, longevity, and finishing the allotted life span. The best marriage for the dragon-year person would be with a person born in the year of the rat, snake, monkey, or rooster. Next best would be one born in the tiger, horse, sheep, or boar year. A bad marriage would be with one born in the ox, rabbit, or dragon year. The worst would be with one born in the year of the dog.

6	Earth Snake	Regarded as wise, but inwardly naive. Prudent, easily scandalized. Possessive.	PEOPLE born in this year, the year of the snake, are deep. They speak very little and possess tremendous wisdom. They are unbelievably fortunate in money matters in that they never have to worry about them. They will always be able to obtain money whenever they need it. Snake-year people are quite vain and always dress up to the point of foppery. They are selfish and just a bit stingy when they are approached for a loan. Yet people born in the snake year have tremendous sympathy for others and will try to help them, much to the annoyance of those they are helping, since snake-year people habitually overdo anything they do. This cannot be helped because snake people have doubts about other people's judgment and prefer to rely on their own accumulated wisdom. They are very determined in what they do and hate to fail at anything, and although they are calm by nature, they are most intense; if they shoot an arrow at a target, they must hit that target. People born in the snake year are quite passionate and are handsome if they are men and beauties if they are women. A compliment to a Japanese woman is to tell her that she is a mi-bijin, which means a snake-year beauty. However, people born in the snake year will always have marital troubles, for snake-year spouses have affections outside of the family. If they were to confine such affection to their immediate family, their lives would be much smoother. Great care must be taken in the third phase of a snake-year person's life, for it is the last phase that is the worst. Snake-year people would be wise to marry anyone born in either the ox or the rooster year. The next best marriage for them would be with those born in either the rat, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, or dog year. A bad marriage would be with someone born in the monkey year, and the worst would be with a person born in either the tiger or the boar year.

7	Metal Horse	Sociable, prejudiced, selfish, intolerant. Fond of sport and travel.	HORSE-YEAR people are very skillful in paying compliments and are quite popular. They are very cheerful people, but they talk too much. They are also very skillful with money and handle finances well. They are quick in everything they do and are able to grasp other people's meanings even before these people have a chance to think out what they want to say. They an. wise and talented and are good with their hands. Horse-year people are very decorative and showy in dress and manner. Although clever-looking, appearing as though they will never lose at anything they do, inside they are rather weak, especially toward members of the other sex; and if they are involved, whatever project they might be working on, they will fail at it. Horse-year people are not noted for their patience. They are hot-blooded, but in their everyday work they can be dispassionate over what they do. In their affections they are stimulated almost to the point of being blind to everything else. Horse-year people like theatrical entertainment and always go to plays and musicals, conventions, operas-almost any place where there are entertainers and large crowds. Horse people anger quickly, and by showing their anger they lose whatever confidence people may have had in them. They are terribly independent. They will not listen to advice, and as soon as they are able, they must strike out on their own, breaking away from family influence. During the first and second phases of their life, horse people will have much trouble, but during the third phase they will have a good life. Tiger-year, dog-year, and sheep-year people would make the best marriage for those born in the horse year. The next best would be those born in either the dragon, snake, monkey, rooster, or boar year. A bad marriage for horse people would be a marriage to people born in the year of the ox, rabbit, or horse. The worst marriage would be with one born in the rat year.

8	Metal Sheep	Fastidious, conservative, methodical. Dislikes disorder, but does not always have a method.	ELEGANT, highly accomplished in the arts, passionate by nature, a person born in the sheep year would, at first glance, seem to be better off than people born in the zodiac's other years. It is not so. For people born in the year of the sheep are shy, pessimistic, puzzled about life, and uncertain over what direction they should take. Deeply religious and timid by nature-timid to the point of a woman's timidity-they are never the world's conquerors or leaders. They are clumsy in speech and make poor salesmen, yet they are passionate in whatever they do and whatever they believe in, and not just in their affections either. Because they are uncertain about themselves and what they should do, sheep people must be guided, and in this case they will be best at the arts. Throughout their whole life, people born in the sheep year will never have problems over i-shoku-ju (having clothes, a good table, and comfortable living), for their abilities will always make money for them so that they will always be able to exercise their good taste. Wise and gentle in their ways, sheep people are easily stimulated to pity for those who are unfortunate. They are the sort of people who, upon hearing of a family that is destitute, will leave packages of food at their door or anonymously send them money, expecting no thanks and not wanting any. They would be too embarrassed to receive thanks. People born in the sheep year will have love and emotional problems during the second phase of their life, but during the third phase they will have extreme good fortune. The best marriage for a sheep-year person would be with either a rabbit-year person, a boar-year person, or a person born in the year of the horse. Next best would be one born in the year of the tiger, dragon, snake, sheep, monkey, or rooster. A bad marriage would be with one born in the rat year, and the worst would be with one born in either the ox or the dog year.

9	Water Monkey	Audacious, insecure. Hyperactive, manic-depressive. Resents not being taken seriously. Inventive and agile. 	PEOPLE born in the year of the monkey are the erratic geniuses of the cycle. Clever and skillful in grand-scale operations, they are adroit when making financial deals. They are surprisingly inventive and original and are able to solve the most difficult problems with astonishing ease. There are few fields in which a person born in this year would not be successful. Monkey-year people have a disconcerting habit of agreeing with others. They feel more comfortable when they agree, but this sort of agreement is merely a policy tactic. If a monkey-year person sets out to do something and is unable to start immediately, he becomes discouraged and abandons the project even before he has actually tried it. Monkey people have a poor opinion of other people and tend to hold them in contempt. Yet monkey people are prized for their skills, talents, and flexibility. They are good at making decisions and have common-sense practicality. They are fired with a deep desire for knowledge, and they read, see, and know a great deal. They have good memories and can recall fine points and details with ease. They are also passionate and strong-natured, but they tend to cool off quickly. They become famous if they are allowed to pursue their own course. Monkey people, for all their negative qualities, are needed for their skills. The second phase in the monkey person's life is the worst, for he will be distracted and confused, and plans will go awry. The monkey-year man's relations with women will not be good. Monkey-year people must also be careful about over explaining, for by talking too much they will drive people away. The best marriage partner for monkey people would be someone born in the dragon or the rat year. The next best would be a person born in the year of the rabbit, sheep, or dog. A bad marriage would be one with a snake.:.year or a boar-year person, and the worst would be with someone born in the tiger year.

10	Water Rooster	Alert, punctual. Frank, abrasive, competitive. Shrewd and precise; extravagant.	"ROOSTER-YEAR people are deep thinkers. They are always busy and devoted to their work. They always want to do more than they are able, and if they undertake a task beyond their abilities, they are disappointed when they discover they are unable to fulfill their obligation. People born in this year are eccentric, and it is this eccentricity that prevents them from having what is known in Japan as a ""roundness"" in their relationships with others. rooster people always think that they are right and that they know what they are doing. They do not trust other people and prefer to do what they like, alone. Their outward attitude and presentation is that of an adventuresome spirit, but inwardly they have little gift for high adventure and are filled with nonsensical plans that never mature. Although they are ambitious, for all their deep thinking they are not far-seeing and are somewhat improvident, for their fortunes resemble waves: sometimes they are wealthy, sometimes not. They are selfish and unheeding of other people's feelings and have a habit of speaking out directly whenever they have something on their minds. They are not at all shy and are quite brave when the occasion calls for it. Other people find rooster people interesting, but unless they are careful, rooster people will lose the good opinion of others. The best marriage for this sort of person is with either ox-year, snake-year, or dragon-year people. The next best would be with someone born In the year of the tiger, horse, sheep, monkey, or boar. A bad marriage would be with someone born in the rat year, rooster year, or dog year. The worst marriage would be with someone born in the year of the rabbit."

11	Wood Dog	Honest, friendly, protective and defensive. Sociable, loyal to friends, reliable.	ALL the fine traits of human nature are in the possession of people born in the year of the dog. They have a deep sense of duty and loyalty, are extremely honest, and always do their best in their relationships with people. Dog-year people inspire other people's confidence and know how to keep private secrets absolutely private. Other people hold dog-year people in high regard and consider them fine persons. Yet dog-year people are somewhat selfish, terribly stubborn, and exceedingly eccentric. They care little for wealth yet always seem to manage to obtain money when they need it. They are not good at social gatherings, and emotionally they are cold. If there is any worst trait about these people it is their ability to find fault with things and their caustic remarks criticizing what they think wrong. They have terribly sharp tongues. It will be noted that throughout history it has always been a person who was born in the year of the dog who has been the champion of justice. Goaded by whatever injustice he may see, a dog-year person will not rest until right has been established. Eccentric as he is, he does not champion stupid causes, which is a good thing after all, for when a dog-year person takes up a cause he generally sees it through, and the side he takes up wins. Dog people are not noted for small talk, yet they make good leaders in industry. They are able to handle people when it is necessary, and trading firms or big business firms would be wise to hire such people for their industriousness and honesty. Surprisingly, for all the dog-year person's cool temperament, marriage with either horse-year, tiger-year, or rabbit-year people would be best. Next best would be marriage with a person born in the year of the rat, snake, monkey, dog, or boar. A bad marriage would be one with someone born in the year of the ox or the year of the rooster. The worst would be with someone born in either the dragon year or the sheep year.	Yang	11	11	Libra	1	128-dog.png	Dog	1934-02-14	1935-02-03	1994-02-10	1995-01-30
12	Wood Boar	Content, home and family loving. Practical, acquisitive, industrious.	CHIVALROUS and gallant, people born in the year of the boar are always flying the white banner of purity. Whatever their ambition, they do what they must with all the strength they have, for their strength is an inner strength that no one can overcome. There is neither left nor right nor retreat when a boar person sets out to do something. He has tremendous fortitude and great honesty. Boar-year people don't make many friends, but when they do, they make friends for life, and anyone having a boar-year-born person as a friend is indeed fortunate. Boar-year people don't talk much, but when they finally say something, they let it all come out at one time, and there is no shutting them up until they have finished. Like monkey-year people, they have a great thirst for knowledge. They study a great deal and on the surface are generally well informed. However, if a boar person's knowledge is probed, it will be discovered that what he knows is limited. The Japanese saying is that such a person is broad in front but has a narrow back. Boar people are quite short-tempered, yet they hate quarreling or arguments. They are affectionate and kind to their loved ones. Boar people will have marital problems, and during the first and second phases of their lives they will have difficulties. Yet no matter how difficult their problems may be, boar people are shy and will not ask for outside help hut will seek solutions to their problems by themselves. Boar people are advised not to get into lawsuits, for, being impulsive and honest, they will lose the suit to someone who is unscrupulous. Rabbit and sheep people make the best spouses for those born in the year of the boar. The next best choice of a spouse would be any of those born in the rat, ox, tiger, dragon, horse, rooster, or dog year. A bad marriage would be with one born in either the monkey or the boar year, and the worst person to marry would be someone born in the year of the snake.

However, dragon-year people are honest, sensitive, and brave and can inspire trust in almost everyone. They are the most eccentric of any in the cycle. They don't like to borrow money, or to make complimentary or flowery speeches. Yet they are sincere in what they say, and their opinions are valid. They are capable of doing good work and devoting themselves to good works. But they can be just as strong in devoting themselves to evil. They are quite softhearted and are taken in by any sort of line. This gives other people tremendous advantage over them. Dragon people worry a great deal, and for no good reason. They are not prone to marry early, and in some cases not at all. This may account for their loneliness in their old age. Yet other people love them. Dragon-born people are somewhat fastidious. This makes it rather difficult for them in the first phase of their life. During the second phase, their fortunes will be like waves, and in the final phase, they will at last have peace and contentment. Dragon people do have big mouths and, when excited, say a great deal they don't mean, but normally they are not gossipers. Men born in the dragon year are also considered fortunate, for the dragon represents the greatest celestial power and is one of the two most beneficial astrological influences. The dragon symbolizes life and growth and is said to bring the five blessings: riches, harmony, virtue, longevity, and finishing the allotted life span. The best marriage for the dragon-year person would be with a person born in the year of the rat, snake, monkey, or rooster. Next best would be one born in the tiger, horse, sheep, or boar year. A bad marriage would be with one born in the ox, rabbit, or dragon year. The worst would be with one born in the year of the dog.

18	Metal Snake	Regarded as wise, but inwardly naive. Prudent, easily scandalized. Possessive.	PEOPLE born in this year, the year of the snake, are deep. They speak very little and possess tremendous wisdom. They are unbelievably fortunate in money matters in that they never have to worry about them. They will always be able to obtain money whenever they need it. Snake-year people are quite vain and always dress up to the point of foppery. They are selfish and just a bit stingy when they are approached for a loan. Yet people born in the snake year have tremendous sympathy for others and will try to help them, much to the annoyance of those they are helping, since snake-year people habitually overdo anything they do. This cannot be helped because snake people have doubts about other people's judgment and prefer to rely on their own accumulated wisdom. They are very determined in what they do and hate to fail at anything, and although they are calm by nature, they are most intense; if they shoot an arrow at a target, they must hit that target. People born in the snake year are quite passionate and are handsome if they are men and beauties if they are women. A compliment to a Japanese woman is to tell her that she is a mi-bijin, which means a snake-year beauty. However, people born in the snake year will always have marital troubles, for snake-year spouses have affections outside of the family. If they were to confine such affection to their immediate family, their lives would be much smoother. Great care must be taken in the third phase of a snake-year person's life, for it is the last phase that is the worst. Snake-year people would be wise to marry anyone born in either the ox or the rooster year. The next best marriage for them would be with those born in either the rat, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, or dog year. A bad marriage would be with someone born in the monkey year, and the worst would be with a person born in either the tiger or the boar year.

19	Water Horse	Sociable, prejudiced, selfish, intolerant. Fond of sport and travel.	HORSE-YEAR people are very skillful in paying compliments and are quite popular. They are very cheerful people, but they talk too much. They are also very skillful with money and handle finances well. They are quick in everything they do and are able to grasp other people's meanings even before these people have a chance to think out what they want to say. They an. wise and talented and are good with their hands. Horse-year people are very decorative and showy in dress and manner. Although clever-looking, appearing as though they will never lose at anything they do, inside they are rather weak, especially toward members of the other sex; and if they are involved, whatever project they might be working on, they will fail at it. Horse-year people are not noted for their patience. They are hot-blooded, but in their everyday work they can be dispassionate over what they do. In their affections they are stimulated almost to the point of being blind to everything else. Horse-year people like theatrical entertainment and always go to plays and musicals, conventions, operas-almost any place where there are entertainers and large crowds. Horse people anger quickly, and by showing their anger they lose whatever confidence people may have had in them. They are terribly independent. They will not listen to advice, and as soon as they are able, they must strike out on their own, breaking away from family influence. During the first and second phases of their life, horse people will have much trouble, but during the third phase they will have a good life. Tiger-year, dog-year, and sheep-year people would make the best marriage for those born in the horse year. The next best would be those born in either the dragon, snake, monkey, rooster, or boar year. A bad marriage for horse people would be a marriage to people born in the year of the ox, rabbit, or horse. The worst marriage would be with one born in the rat year.

20	Water Sheep	Fastidious, conservative, methodical. Dislikes disorder, but does not always have a method.	ELEGANT, highly accomplished in the arts, passionate by nature, a person born in the sheep year would, at first glance, seem to be better off than people born in the zodiac's other years. It is not so. For people born in the year of the sheep are shy, pessimistic, puzzled about life, and uncertain over what direction they should take. Deeply religious and timid by nature-timid to the point of a woman's timidity-they are never the world's conquerors or leaders. They are clumsy in speech and make poor salesmen, yet they are passionate in whatever they do and whatever they believe in, and not just in their affections either. Because they are uncertain about themselves and what they should do, sheep people must be guided, and in this case they will be best at the arts. Throughout their whole life, people born in the sheep year will never have problems over i-shoku-ju (having clothes, a good table, and comfortable living), for their abilities will always make money for them so that they will always be able to exercise their good taste. Wise and gentle in their ways, sheep people are easily stimulated to pity for those who are unfortunate. They are the sort of people who, upon hearing of a family that is destitute, will leave packages of food at their door or anonymously send them money, expecting no thanks and not wanting any. They would be too embarrassed to receive thanks. People born in the sheep year will have love and emotional problems during the second phase of their life, but during the third phase they will have extreme good fortune. The best marriage for a sheep-year person would be with either a rabbit-year person, a boar-year person, or a person born in the year of the horse. Next best would be one born in the year of the tiger, dragon, snake, sheep, monkey, or rooster. A bad marriage would be with one born in the rat year, and the worst would be with one born in either the ox or the dog year.

21	Wood Monkey	Audacious, insecure. Hyperactive, manic-depressive. Resents not being taken seriously. Inventive and agile. 	PEOPLE born in the year of the monkey are the erratic geniuses of the cycle. Clever and skillful in grand-scale operations, they are adroit when making financial deals. They are surprisingly inventive and original and are able to solve the most difficult problems with astonishing ease. There are few fields in which a person born in this year would not be successful. Monkey-year people have a disconcerting habit of agreeing with others. They feel more comfortable when they agree, but this sort of agreement is merely a policy tactic. If a monkey-year person sets out to do something and is unable to start immediately, he becomes discouraged and abandons the project even before he has actually tried it. Monkey people have a poor opinion of other people and tend to hold them in contempt. Yet monkey people are prized for their skills, talents, and flexibility. They are good at making decisions and have common-sense practicality. They are fired with a deep desire for knowledge, and they read, see, and know a great deal. They have good memories and can recall fine points and details with ease. They are also passionate and strong-natured, but they tend to cool off quickly. They become famous if they are allowed to pursue their own course. Monkey people, for all their negative qualities, are needed for their skills. The second phase in the monkey person's life is the worst, for he will be distracted and confused, and plans will go awry. The monkey-year man's relations with women will not be good. Monkey-year people must also be careful about over explaining, for by talking too much they will drive people away. The best marriage partner for monkey people would be someone born in the dragon or the rat year. The next best would be a person born in the year of the rabbit, sheep, or dog. A bad marriage would be one with a snake.:.year or a boar-year person, and the worst would be with someone born in the tiger year.

22	Wood Rooster	Alert, punctual. Frank, abrasive, competitive. Shrewd and precise; extravagant.	"ROOSTER-YEAR people are deep thinkers. They are always busy and devoted to their work. They always want to do more than they are able, and if they undertake a task beyond their abilities, they are disappointed when they discover they are unable to fulfill their obligation. People born in this year are eccentric, and it is this eccentricity that prevents them from having what is known in Japan as a ""roundness"" in their relationships with others. rooster people always think that they are right and that they know what they are doing. They do not trust other people and prefer to do what they like, alone. Their outward attitude and presentation is that of an adventuresome spirit, but inwardly they have little gift for high adventure and are filled with nonsensical plans that never mature. Although they are ambitious, for all their deep thinking they are not far-seeing and are somewhat improvident, for their fortunes resemble waves: sometimes they are wealthy, sometimes not. They are selfish and unheeding of other people's feelings and have a habit of speaking out directly whenever they have something on their minds. They are not at all shy and are quite brave when the occasion calls for it. Other people find rooster people interesting, but unless they are careful, rooster people will lose the good opinion of others. The best marriage for this sort of person is with either ox-year, snake-year, or dragon-year people. The next best would be with someone born In the year of the tiger, horse, sheep, monkey, or boar. A bad marriage would be with someone born in the rat year, rooster year, or dog year. The worst marriage would be with someone born in the year of the rabbit."

23	Fire Dog	Honest, friendly, protective and defensive. Sociable, loyal to friends, reliable.	ALL the fine traits of human nature are in the possession of people born in the year of the dog. They have a deep sense of duty and loyalty, are extremely honest, and always do their best in their relationships with people. Dog-year people inspire other people's confidence and know how to keep private secrets absolutely private. Other people hold dog-year people in high regard and consider them fine persons. Yet dog-year people are somewhat selfish, terribly stubborn, and exceedingly eccentric. They care little for wealth yet always seem to manage to obtain money when they need it. They are not good at social gatherings, and emotionally they are cold. If there is any worst trait about these people it is their ability to find fault with things and their caustic remarks criticizing what they think wrong. They have terribly sharp tongues. It will be noted that throughout history it has always been a person who was born in the year of the dog who has been the champion of justice. Goaded by whatever injustice he may see, a dog-year person will not rest until right has been established. Eccentric as he is, he does not champion stupid causes, which is a good thing after all, for when a dog-year person takes up a cause he generally sees it through, and the side he takes up wins. Dog people are not noted for small talk, yet they make good leaders in industry. They are able to handle people when it is necessary, and trading firms or big business firms would be wise to hire such people for their industriousness and honesty. Surprisingly, for all the dog-year person's cool temperament, marriage with either horse-year, tiger-year, or rabbit-year people would be best. Next best would be marriage with a person born in the year of the rat, snake, monkey, dog, or boar. A bad marriage would be one with someone born in the year of the ox or the year of the rooster. The worst would be with someone born in either the dragon year or the sheep year.	Yang	11	23	Libra	2	128-dog.png	Dog	1946-02-02	1947-01-21	2006-01-29	2007-02-17
24	Fire Boar	Content, home and family loving. Practical, acquisitive, industrious.	CHIVALROUS and gallant, people born in the year of the boar are always flying the white banner of purity. Whatever their ambition, they do what they must with all the strength they have, for their strength is an inner strength that no one can overcome. There is neither left nor right nor retreat when a boar person sets out to do something. He has tremendous fortitude and great honesty. Boar-year people don't make many friends, but when they do, they make friends for life, and anyone having a boar-year-born person as a friend is indeed fortunate. Boar-year people don't talk much, but when they finally say something, they let it all come out at one time, and there is no shutting them up until they have finished. Like monkey-year people, they have a great thirst for knowledge. They study a great deal and on the surface are generally well informed. However, if a boar person's knowledge is probed, it will be discovered that what he knows is limited. The Japanese saying is that such a person is broad in front but has a narrow back. Boar people are quite short-tempered, yet they hate quarreling or arguments. They are affectionate and kind to their loved ones. Boar people will have marital problems, and during the first and second phases of their lives they will have difficulties. Yet no matter how difficult their problems may be, boar people are shy and will not ask for outside help hut will seek solutions to their problems by themselves. Boar people are advised not to get into lawsuits, for, being impulsive and honest, they will lose the suit to someone who is unscrupulous. Rabbit and sheep people make the best spouses for those born in the year of the boar. The next best choice of a spouse would be any of those born in the rat, ox, tiger, dragon, horse, rooster, or dog year. A bad marriage would be with one born in either the monkey or the boar year, and the worst person to marry would be someone born in the year of the snake.

25	Earth Rat	Charming, appealing, clever. Quick-witted and sociable. Hoarders and wasters.	"PEOPLE born in the year of the rat are noted for their charm. However, they are fussy about small matters and have a tendency to pinch pennies. When such people want something very much, they will work hard for the thing desired. Because they are thrifty, they are able to save a great deal of money. Unfortunately, they may lose what they have saved by spending it on someone they love who does not love them. Curiously enough, only through love does a person born in this year become generous. Although people born in this year can maintain an outward show of control, they are easily angered. Their value lies in the fact that they are able to control their discontent or anger. Small-minded as these people are, they are quite honest and ambitious and have a tremendous capacity for pursuing a course to its end. They love to spend money on themselves, denying themselves nothing, but they don't lend. They love to gossip, and because of this characteristic they are apt to have short-term friends. They will have good fortune in the first phase of their life. But in the second phase they will lose everything they have at one time through a mistakenly taken chance or a shattering love affair. Yet in the latter part of their life they will live well and comfortably. A person born in the year of the rat would do well to marry someone born in either the dragon, the monkey, or the ox year, for people of these years are temperamentally suited to those of the rat year. The next best choice would be one born in the year of the rat, tiger, snake, dog, or boar. The worst would be with one born in the horse year, and it would be doubly disastrous for a rat-year man to marry a woman born in the year called the ""fire horse year,"" which comes every sixty years. A popular superstition claims that a man marrying such a woman does not live out his full span of life."	Yang	1	25	Sagittarius	3	128-rat.png	Rat	1948-02-10	1949-01-28	2008-02-07	2009-01-25
26	Earth Ox	Methodical, routine. Dependable, sullen. Dislikes competition.	PEOPLE born in the year of the ox are very patient and speak little. They have a gift for inspiring confidence in others, and this allows them to achieve a great deal of success. They are, however, eccentric and terribly bigoted. If people dislike them, it is for this reason only. For all their patience and reticence, there is a paradoxical quality to their temperament; they anger easily and they show it. It would be wise to avoid an ox-year person when he is angry, for he is likely to do something rash to anyone confronting him. Ox-year people are mentally alert, and although they are not prone to speaking much, when required to speak they can be eloquent. They are dexterous to the point of genius and can do all sorts of things with their hands. For all their placid and easygoing ways, they are remarkably stubborn, and they hate to fail at anything they do. If they are opposed when they want to work on a project they favor, their patience may wear thin, and they can be quite unpleasant. Ox-year people regard affection between men and women as a sort of game they cannot understand, and this rather cool attitude causes their families to have difficulties with them over emotional matters. The first phase of their life will be generally happy. The second phase will not be good; family or marital difficulties will occur, and for that period ox people will lose the respect of those who once admired them. But in their third phase of their life, whatever rough edges there might have been will be smoothed out. Marriage for people born in the ox year is rather peculiar. The best marriages would be with persons born in either the snake year, the rooster year, or the rat year; the next best, with those born in the ox, dragon, rabbit, monkey, or boar year. An ox-year person would have a bad marriage with a person born in the horse or the dog year, and the worst possible marriage would be with anyone born in the sheep year.

27	Metal Tiger	Fiercely competitive; rash, brave, magnetic. Proud, unrestrained.	"TIGER people are sensitive, short-tempered, given to deep thinking, and capable of great sympathy for those of whom they are fond. Other people have deep respect for those born in the year of the tiger, but on occasion tiger-born people come into conflict with older people or those who have higher authority. People give tiger people much more credit for achievement than they deserve. Tiger people cannot make up their minds quickly enough and delay an important decision until it is too late to make a good one. They have somewhat narrow minds and are highly suspicious of other people and don't trust them. Although courageous and stubborn, tiger people can be selfish and just a bit mean. Yet, among Asian people, and especially the people of Japan, it is a fortuitous thing for a man to be born in the year of the tiger. The tiger, it is believed, represents the greatest terrestrial power and stands as an emblem of protection over human life. It chases away the ""three disasters"": thieves, fire, and ghosts. The first and third phases of the tiger-born person's life will be smooth and easygoing. It is the second phase that will bring the most difficulties. Unless the problems during the second phase are handled carefully, they may overlap and run into the third phase. Horse-year, dragon-year, or dog-year people make the best spouses for tiger-born people. Rat, ox, rabbit, tiger, sheep, rooster, and boar are second choices. The worst marriage for a tiger-born person would be with either a snake-year or a monkey-year person. "	Yang	3	27	Aquarius	4	128-tiger.png	Tiger	1950-02-17	1951-02-05	2010-02-14	2011-02-02
28	Metal Rabbit	Gregarious, but aloof. Avoids confrontation. Benevolent, inclined to gossip. Artistic.	PEOPLE born in the year of the rabbit are the most fortunate. They are smooth talkers, talented and ambitious. Virtuous and reserved, they have exceedingly fine tastes, and other people regard them with admiration and deeply trust them. Rabbit people are always financially lucky. They have a fondness for mild gossip, but they are tactful and do not speak out willingly if they have to say something bad about someone. They are very affectionate to those they love but are curiously detached from their families, regarding the other members as little better than strangers. Rabbit people have to be goaded for quite a while before they lose their tempers, for by temperament they are placid. They are very clever at business, and if someone signs a contract with a rabbit person, there can be no backing out of it. Rabbit people are temperamentally melancholy and are able to weep at the slightest provocation. They are somewhat pedantic and not very well informed, so that, although what they know they know well, they will not seek out further information on other subjects. Rabbit people would make good gamblers, for they have the uncanny gift of picking the sure thing. They are a bit conservative and do not plunge into anything without first thinking it over carefully. Some Japanese regard rabbits with suspicion, for there is a belief that witches sometimes take the form of a rabbit. Rabbit people will have a placid existence throughout all three phases of their lives, provided they do not become involved with unmanageable elements. Rabbit people would do well to marry persons born in either the sheep, the boar, or the dog year. A bad marriage would be with someone born in the dragon year, and the worst would be with someone from either the rat or the rooster year.

33	Fire Monkey	Audacious, insecure. Hyperactive, manic-depressive. Resents not being taken seriously. Inventive and agile. 	PEOPLE born in the year of the monkey are the erratic geniuses of the cycle. Clever and skillful in grand-scale operations, they are adroit when making financial deals. They are surprisingly inventive and original and are able to solve the most difficult problems with astonishing ease. There are few fields in which a person born in this year would not be successful. Monkey-year people have a disconcerting habit of agreeing with others. They feel more comfortable when they agree, but this sort of agreement is merely a policy tactic. If a monkey-year person sets out to do something and is unable to start immediately, he becomes discouraged and abandons the project even before he has actually tried it. Monkey people have a poor opinion of other people and tend to hold them in contempt. Yet monkey people are prized for their skills, talents, and flexibility. They are good at making decisions and have common-sense practicality. They are fired with a deep desire for knowledge, and they read, see, and know a great deal. They have good memories and can recall fine points and details with ease. They are also passionate and strong-natured, but they tend to cool off quickly. They become famous if they are allowed to pursue their own course. Monkey people, for all their negative qualities, are needed for their skills. The second phase in the monkey person's life is the worst, for he will be distracted and confused, and plans will go awry. The monkey-year man's relations with women will not be good. Monkey-year people must also be careful about over explaining, for by talking too much they will drive people away. The best marriage partner for monkey people would be someone born in the dragon or the rat year. The next best would be a person born in the year of the rabbit, sheep, or dog. A bad marriage would be one with a snake.:.year or a boar-year person, and the worst would be with someone born in the tiger year.

34	Fire Rooster	Alert, punctual. Frank, abrasive, competitive. Shrewd and precise; extravagant.	"ROOSTER-YEAR people are deep thinkers. They are always busy and devoted to their work. They always want to do more than they are able, and if they undertake a task beyond their abilities, they are disappointed when they discover they are unable to fulfill their obligation. People born in this year are eccentric, and it is this eccentricity that prevents them from having what is known in Japan as a ""roundness"" in their relationships with others. rooster people always think that they are right and that they know what they are doing. They do not trust other people and prefer to do what they like, alone. Their outward attitude and presentation is that of an adventuresome spirit, but inwardly they have little gift for high adventure and are filled with nonsensical plans that never mature. Although they are ambitious, for all their deep thinking they are not far-seeing and are somewhat improvident, for their fortunes resemble waves: sometimes they are wealthy, sometimes not. They are selfish and unheeding of other people's feelings and have a habit of speaking out directly whenever they have something on their minds. They are not at all shy and are quite brave when the occasion calls for it. Other people find rooster people interesting, but unless they are careful, rooster people will lose the good opinion of others. The best marriage for this sort of person is with either ox-year, snake-year, or dragon-year people. The next best would be with someone born In the year of the tiger, horse, sheep, monkey, or boar.

35	Earth Dog	Honest, friendly, protective and defensive. Sociable, loyal to friends, reliable.	ALL the fine traits of human nature are in the possession of people born in the year of the dog. They have a deep sense of duty and loyalty, are extremely honest, and always do their best in their relationships with people. Dog-year people inspire other people's confidence and know how to keep private secrets absolutely private. Other people hold dog-year people in high regard and consider them fine persons. Yet dog-year people are somewhat selfish, terribly stubborn, and exceedingly eccentric. They care little for wealth yet always seem to manage to obtain money when they need it. They are not good at social gatherings, and emotionally they are cold. If there is any worst trait about these people it is their ability to find fault with things and their caustic remarks criticizing what they think wrong. They have terribly sharp tongues. It will be noted that throughout history it has always been a person who was born in the year of the dog who has been the champion of justice. Goaded by whatever injustice he may see, a dog-year person will not rest until right has been established. Eccentric as he is, he does not champion stupid causes, which is a good thing after all, for when a dog-year person takes up a cause he generally sees it through, and the side he takes up wins. Dog people are not noted for small talk, yet they make good leaders in industry. They are able to handle people when it is necessary, and trading firms or big business firms would be wise to hire such people for their industriousness and honesty. Surprisingly, for all the dog-year person's cool temperament, marriage with either horse-year, tiger-year, or rabbit-year people would be best. Next best would be marriage with a person born in the year of the rat, snake, monkey, dog, or boar. A bad marriage would be one with someone born in the year of the ox or the year of the rooster. The worst would be with someone born in either the dragon year or the sheep year.	Yang	11	35	Libra	3	128-dog.png	Dog	1958-02-18	1959-02-07	2018-02-16	2019-02-04
36	Earth Boar	Content, home and family loving. Practical, acquisitive, industrious.	CHIVALROUS and gallant, people born in the year of the boar are always flying the white banner of purity. Whatever their ambition, they do what they must with all the strength they have, for their strength is an inner strength that no one can overcome. There is neither left nor right nor retreat when a boar person sets out to do something. He has tremendous fortitude and great honesty. Boar-year people don't make many friends, but when they do, they make friends for life, and anyone having a boar-year-born person as a friend is indeed fortunate. Boar-year people don't talk much, but when they finally say something, they let it all come out at one time, and there is no shutting them up until they have finished. Like monkey-year people, they have a great thirst for knowledge. They study a great deal and on the surface are generally well informed. However, if a boar person's knowledge is probed, it will be discovered that what he knows is limited. The Japanese saying is that such a person is broad in front but has a narrow back. Boar people are quite short-tempered, yet they hate quarreling or arguments. They are affectionate and kind to their loved ones. Boar people will have marital problems, and during the first and second phases of their lives they will have difficulties. Yet no matter how difficult their problems may be, boar people are shy and will not ask for outside help hut will seek solutions to their problems by themselves. Boar people are advised not to get into lawsuits, for, being impulsive and honest, they will lose the suit to someone who is unscrupulous. Rabbit and sheep people make the best spouses for those born in the year of the boar. The next best choice of a spouse would be any of those born in the rat, ox, tiger, dragon, horse, rooster, or dog year. A bad marriage would be with one born in either the monkey or the boar year, and the worst person to marry would be someone born in the year of the snake.

37	Metal Rat	Charming, appealing, clever. Quick-witted and sociable. Hoarders and wasters.	"PEOPLE born in the year of the rat are noted for their charm. However, they are fussy about small matters and have a tendency to pinch pennies. When such people want something very much, they will work hard for the thing desired. Because they are thrifty, they are able to save a great deal of money. Unfortunately, they may lose what they have saved by spending it on someone they love who does not love them. Curiously enough, only through love does a person born in this year become generous. Although people born in this year can maintain an outward show of control, they are easily angered. Their value lies in the fact that they are able to control their discontent or anger. Small-minded as these people are, they are quite honest and ambitious and have a tremendous capacity for pursuing a course to its end. They love to spend money on themselves, denying themselves nothing, but they don't lend. They love to gossip, and because of this characteristic they are apt to have short-term friends. They will have good fortune in the first phase of their life. But in the second phase they will lose everything they have at one time through a mistakenly taken chance or a shattering love affair. Yet in the latter part of their life they will live well and comfortably. A person born in the year of the rat would do well to marry someone born in either the dragon, the monkey, or the ox year, for people of these years are temperamentally suited to those of the rat year. The next best choice would be one born in the year of the rat, tiger, snake, dog, or boar. The worst would be with one born in the horse year, and it would be doubly disastrous for a rat-year man to marry a woman born in the year called the ""fire horse year,"" which comes every sixty years. A popular superstition claims that a man marrying such a woman does not live out his full span of life."	Yang	1	37	Sagittarius	4	128-rat.png	Rat	1960-01-28	1961-02-14	2020-01-25	2021-02-11
38	Metal Ox	Methodical, routine. Dependable, sullen. Dislikes competition.	PEOPLE born in the year of the ox are very patient and speak little. They have a gift for inspiring confidence in others, and this allows them to achieve a great deal of success. They are, however, eccentric and terribly bigoted. If people dislike them, it is for this reason only. For all their patience and reticence, there is a paradoxical quality to their temperament; they anger easily and they show it. It would be wise to avoid an ox-year person when he is angry, for he is likely to do something rash to anyone confronting him. Ox-year people are mentally alert, and although they are not prone to speaking much, when required to speak they can be eloquent. They are dexterous to the point of genius and can do all sorts of things with their hands. For all their placid and easygoing ways, they are remarkably stubborn, and they hate to fail at anything they do. If they are opposed when they want to work on a project they favor, their patience may wear thin, and they can be quite unpleasant. Ox-year people regard affection between men and women as a sort of game they cannot understand, and this rather cool attitude causes their families to have difficulties with them over emotional matters. The first phase of their life will be generally happy. The second phase will not be good; family or marital difficulties will occur, and for that period ox people will lose the respect of those who once admired them. But in their third phase of their life, whatever rough edges there might have been will be smoothed out. Marriage for people born in the ox year is rather peculiar. The best marriages would be with persons born in either the snake year, the rooster year, or the rat year; the next best, with those born in the ox, dragon, rabbit, monkey, or boar year. An ox-year person would have a bad marriage with a person born in the horse or the dog year, and the worst possible marriage would be with anyone born in the sheep year.

39	Water Tiger	Fiercely competitive; rash, brave, magnetic. Proud, unrestrained.	"TIGER people are sensitive, short-tempered, given to deep thinking, and capable of great sympathy for those of whom they are fond. Other people have deep respect for those born in the year of the tiger, but on occasion tiger-born people come into conflict with older people or those who have higher authority. People give tiger people much more credit for achievement than they deserve. Tiger people cannot make up their minds quickly enough and delay an important decision until it is too late to make a good one. They have somewhat narrow minds and are highly suspicious of other people and don't trust them. Although courageous and stubborn, tiger people can be selfish and just a bit mean. Yet, among Asian people, and especially the people of Japan, it is a fortuitous thing for a man to be born in the year of the tiger. The tiger, it is believed, represents the greatest terrestrial power and stands as an emblem of protection over human life. It chases away the ""three disasters"": thieves, fire, and ghosts. The first and third phases of the tiger-born person's life will be smooth and easygoing. It is the second phase that will bring the most difficulties. Unless the problems during the second phase are handled carefully, they may overlap and run into the third phase. Horse-year, dragon-year, or dog-year people make the best spouses for tiger-born people. Rat, ox, rabbit, tiger, sheep, rooster, and boar are second choices. The worst marriage for a tiger-born person would be with either a snake-year or a monkey-year person. "	Yang	3	39	Aquarius	5	128-tiger.png	Tiger	1962-02-05	1963-01-25	2022-02-01	2023-01-21
40	Water Rabbit	Gregarious, but aloof. Avoids confrontation. Benevolent, inclined to gossip. Artistic.	PEOPLE born in the year of the rabbit are the most fortunate. They are smooth talkers, talented and ambitious. Virtuous and reserved, they have exceedingly fine tastes, and other people regard them with admiration and deeply trust them. Rabbit people are always financially lucky. They have a fondness for mild gossip, but they are tactful and do not speak out willingly if they have to say something bad about someone. They are very affectionate to those they love but are curiously detached from their families, regarding the other members as little better than strangers. Rabbit people have to be goaded for quite a while before they lose their tempers, for by temperament they are placid. They are very clever at business, and if someone signs a contract with a rabbit person, there can be no backing out of it. Rabbit people are temperamentally melancholy and are able to weep at the slightest provocation. They are somewhat pedantic and not very well informed, so that, although what they know they know well, they will not seek out further information on other subjects. Rabbit people would make good gamblers, for they have the uncanny gift of picking the sure thing. They are a bit conservative and do not plunge into anything without first thinking it over carefully. Some Japanese regard rabbits with suspicion, for there is a belief that witches sometimes take the form of a rabbit. Rabbit people will have a placid existence throughout all three phases of their lives, provided they do not become involved with unmanageable elements. Rabbit people would do well to marry persons born in either the sheep, the boar, or the dog year. A bad marriage would be with someone born in the dragon year, and the worst would be with someone from either the rat or the rooster year.

41	Wood Dragon	Exotic. vital. Elegant, fond of the occult. Decisive, but not methodical. Over-confident, transient.	DRAGON-year people are healthy and energetic and at the same time excitable, short-tempered, and terribly stubborn. These are, of course, typical attributes for the dragon-year person. However, dragon-year people are honest, sensitive, and brave and can inspire trust in almost everyone. They are the most eccentric of any in the cycle. They don't like to borrow money, or to make complimentary or flowery speeches. Yet they are sincere in what they say, and their opinions are valid. They are capable of doing good work and devoting themselves to good works. But they can be just as strong in devoting themselves to evil. They are quite softhearted and are taken in by any sort of line. This gives other people tremendous advantage over them. Dragon people worry a great deal, and for no good reason. They are not prone to marry early, and in some cases not at all. This may account for their loneliness in their old age. Yet other people love them. Dragon-born people are somewhat fastidious. This makes it rather difficult for them in the first phase of their life. During the second phase, their fortunes will be like waves, and in the final phase, they will at last have peace and contentment. Dragon people do have big mouths and, when excited, say a great deal they don't mean, but normally they are not gossipers. Men born in the dragon year are also considered fortunate, for the dragon represents the greatest celestial power and is one of the two most beneficial astrological influences. The dragon symbolizes life and growth and is said to bring the five blessings: riches, harmony, virtue, longevity, and finishing the allotted life span. The best marriage for the dragon-year person would be with a person born in the year of the rat, snake, monkey, or rooster. Next best would be one born in the tiger, horse, sheep, or boar year. A bad marriage would be with one born in the ox, rabbit, or dragon year. The worst would be with one born in the year of the dog.

42	Wood Snake	Regarded as wise, but inwardly naive. Prudent, easily scandalized. Possessive.	PEOPLE born in this year, the year of the snake, are deep. They speak very little and possess tremendous wisdom. They are unbelievably fortunate in money matters in that they never have to worry about them. They will always be able to obtain money whenever they need it. Snake-year people are quite vain and always dress up to the point of foppery. They are selfish and just a bit stingy when they are approached for a loan. Yet people born in the snake year have tremendous sympathy for others and will try to help them, much to the annoyance of those they are helping, since snake-year people habitually overdo anything they do. This cannot be helped because snake people have doubts about other people's judgment and prefer to rely on their own accumulated wisdom. They are very determined in what they do and hate to fail at anything, and although they are calm by nature, they are most intense; if they shoot an arrow at a target, they must hit that target. People born in the snake year are quite passionate and are handsome if they are men and beauties if they are women. A compliment to a Japanese woman is to tell her that she is a mi-bijin, which means a snake-year beauty. However, people born in the snake year will always have marital troubles, for snake-year spouses have affections outside of the family. If they were to confine such affection to their immediate family, their lives would be much smoother. Great care must be taken in the third phase of a snake-year person's life, for it is the last phase that is the worst. Snake-year people would be wise to marry anyone born in either the ox or the rooster year. The next best marriage for them would be with those born in either the rat, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, or dog year. A bad marriage would be with someone born in the monkey year, and the worst would be with a person born in either the tiger or the boar year.

43	Fire Horse	Sociable, prejudiced, selfish, intolerant. Fond of sport and travel.	HORSE-YEAR people are very skillful in paying compliments and are quite popular. They are very cheerful people, but they talk too much. They are also very skillful with money and handle finances well. They are quick in everything they do and are able to grasp other people's meanings even before these people have a chance to think out what they want to say. They an. wise and talented and are good with their hands. Horse-year people are very decorative and showy in dress and manner. Although clever-looking, appearing as though they will never lose at anything they do, inside they are rather weak, especially toward members of the other sex; and if they are involved, whatever project they might be working on, they will fail at it. Horse-year people are not noted for their patience. They are hot-blooded, but in their everyday work they can be dispassionate over what they do. In their affections they are stimulated almost to the point of being blind to everything else. Horse-year people like theatrical entertainment and always go to plays and musicals, conventions, operas-almost any place where there are entertainers and large crowds. Horse people anger quickly, and by showing their anger they lose whatever confidence people may have had in them. They are terribly independent. They will not listen to advice, and as soon as they are able, they must strike out on their own, breaking away from family influence. During the first and second phases of their life, horse people will have much trouble, but during the third phase they will have a good life. Tiger-year, dog-year, and sheep-year people would make the best marriage for those born in the horse year. The next best would be those born in either the dragon, snake, monkey, rooster, or boar year. A bad marriage for horse people would be a marriage to people born in the year of the ox, rabbit, or horse. The worst marriage would be with one born in the rat year.

44	Fire Sheep	Fastidious, conservative, methodical. Dislikes disorder, but does not always have a method.	ELEGANT, highly accomplished in the arts, passionate by nature, a person born in the sheep year would, at first glance, seem to be better off than people born in the zodiac's other years. It is not so. For people born in the year of the sheep are shy, pessimistic, puzzled about life, and uncertain over what direction they should take. Deeply religious and timid by nature-timid to the point of a woman's timidity-they are never the world's conquerors or leaders. They are clumsy in speech and make poor salesmen, yet they are passionate in whatever they do and whatever they believe in, and not just in their affections either. Because they are uncertain about themselves and what they should do, sheep people must be guided, and in this case they will be best at the arts. Throughout their whole life, people born in the sheep year will never have problems over i-shoku-ju (having clothes, a good table, and comfortable living), for their abilities will always make money for them so that they will always be able to exercise their good taste. Wise and gentle in their ways, sheep people are easily stimulated to pity for those who are unfortunate. They are the sort of people who, upon hearing of a family that is destitute, will leave packages of food at their door or anonymously send them money, expecting no thanks and not wanting any. They would be too embarrassed to receive thanks. People born in the sheep year will have love and emotional problems during the second phase of their life, but during the third phase they will have extreme good fortune. The best marriage for a sheep-year person would be with either a rabbit-year person, a boar-year person, or a person born in the year of the horse. Next best would be one born in the year of the tiger, dragon, snake, sheep, monkey, or rooster. A bad marriage would be with one born in the rat year, and the worst would be with one born in either the ox or the dog year.

45	Earth Monkey	Audacious, insecure. Hyperactive, manic-depressive. Resents not being taken seriously. Inventive and agile. 	PEOPLE born in the year of the monkey are the erratic geniuses of the cycle. Clever and skillful in grand-scale operations, they are adroit when making financial deals. They are surprisingly inventive and original and are able to solve the most difficult problems with astonishing ease. There are few fields in which a person born in this year would not be successful. Monkey-year people have a disconcerting habit of agreeing with others. They feel more comfortable when they agree, but this sort of agreement is merely a policy tactic. If a monkey-year person sets out to do something and is unable to start immediately, he becomes discouraged and abandons the project even before he has actually tried it. Monkey people have a poor opinion of other people and tend to hold them in contempt. Yet monkey people are prized for their skills, talents, and flexibility. They are good at making decisions and have common-sense practicality. They are fired with a deep desire for knowledge, and they read, see, and know a great deal. They have good memories and can recall fine points and details with ease. They are also passionate and strong-natured, but they tend to cool off quickly. They become famous if they are allowed to pursue their own course. Monkey people, for all their negative qualities, are needed for their skills. The second phase in the monkey person's life is the worst, for he will be distracted and confused, and plans will go awry. The monkey-year man's relations with women will not be good. Monkey-year people must also be careful about over explaining, for by talking too much they will drive people away. The best marriage partner for monkey people would be someone born in the dragon or the rat year. The next best would be a person born in the year of the rabbit, sheep, or dog. A bad marriage would be one with a snake.:.year or a boar-year person, and the worst would be with someone born in the tiger year.

A bad marriage would be with one born in either the monkey or the boar year, and the worst person to marry would be someone born in the year of the snake.

49	Water Rat	Charming, appealing, clever. Quick-witted and sociable. Hoarders and wasters.	"PEOPLE born in the year of the rat are noted for their charm. However, they are fussy about small matters and have a tendency to pinch pennies. When such people want something very much, they will work hard for the thing desired. Because they are thrifty, they are able to save a great deal of money. Unfortunately, they may lose what they have saved by spending it on someone they love who does not love them. Curiously enough, only through love does a person born in this year become generous. Although people born in this year can maintain an outward show of control, they are easily angered. Their value lies in the fact that they are able to control their discontent or anger. Small-minded as these people are, they are quite honest and ambitious and have a tremendous capacity for pursuing a course to its end. They love to spend money on themselves, denying themselves nothing, but they don't lend. They love to gossip, and because of this characteristic they are apt to have short-term friends. They will have good fortune in the first phase of their life. But in the second phase they will lose everything they have at one time through a mistakenly taken chance or a shattering love affair. Yet in the latter part of their life they will live well and comfortably. A person born in the year of the rat would do well to marry someone born in either the dragon, the monkey, or the ox year, for people of these years are temperamentally suited to those of the rat year. The next best choice would be one born in the year of the rat, tiger, snake, dog, or boar. The worst would be with one born in the horse year, and it would be doubly disastrous for a rat-year man to marry a woman born in the year called the ""fire horse year,"" which comes every sixty years. A popular superstition claims that a man marrying such a woman does not live out his full span of life."	Yang	1	49	Sagittarius	5	128-rat.png	Rat	1972-02-15	1973-02-02	2032-02-11	2033-01-30
50	Water Ox	Methodical, routine. Dependable, sullen. Dislikes competition.	PEOPLE born in the year of the ox are very patient and speak little. They have a gift for inspiring confidence in others, and this allows them to achieve a great deal of success. They are, however, eccentric and terribly bigoted. If people dislike them, it is for this reason only. For all their patience and reticence, there is a paradoxical quality to their temperament; they anger easily and they show it. It would be wise to avoid an ox-year person when he is angry, for he is likely to do something rash to anyone confronting him. Ox-year people are mentally alert, and although they are not prone to speaking much, when required to speak they can be eloquent. They are dexterous to the point of genius and can do all sorts of things with their hands. For all their placid and easygoing ways, they are remarkably stubborn, and they hate to fail at anything they do. If they are opposed when they want to work on a project they favor, their patience may wear thin, and they can be quite unpleasant. Ox-year people regard affection between men and women as a sort of game they cannot understand, and this rather cool attitude causes their families to have difficulties with them over emotional matters. The first phase of their life will be generally happy. The second phase will not be good; family or marital difficulties will occur, and for that period ox people will lose the respect of those who once admired them. But in their third phase of their life, whatever rough edges there might have been will be smoothed out. Marriage for people born in the ox year is rather peculiar. The best marriages would be with persons born in either the snake year, the rooster year, or the rat year; the next best, with those born in the ox, dragon, rabbit, monkey, or boar year. An ox-year person would have a bad marriage with a person born in the horse or the dog year, and the worst possible marriage would be with anyone born in the sheep year.

51	Wood Tiger	Fiercely competitive; rash, brave, magnetic. Proud, unrestrained.	"TIGER people are sensitive, short-tempered, given to deep thinking, and capable of great sympathy for those of whom they are fond. Other people have deep respect for those born in the year of the tiger, but on occasion tiger-born people come into conflict with older people or those who have higher authority. People give tiger people much more credit for achievement than they deserve. Tiger people cannot make up their minds quickly enough and delay an important decision until it is too late to make a good one. They have somewhat narrow minds and are highly suspicious of other people and don't trust them. Although courageous and stubborn, tiger people can be selfish and just a bit mean. Yet, among Asian people, and especially the people of Japan, it is a fortuitous thing for a man to be born in the year of the tiger. The tiger, it is believed, represents the greatest terrestrial power and stands as an emblem of protection over human life. It chases away the ""three disasters"": thieves, fire, and ghosts. The first and third phases of the tiger-born person's life will be smooth and easygoing. It is the second phase that will bring the most difficulties. Unless the problems during the second phase are handled carefully, they may overlap and run into the third phase. Horse-year, dragon-year, or dog-year people make the best spouses for tiger-born people. Rat, ox, rabbit, tiger, sheep, rooster, and boar are second choices. The worst marriage for a tiger-born person would be with either a snake-year or a monkey-year person. "	Yang	3	51	Aquarius	1	128-tiger.png	Tiger	1974-01-23	1975-02-10	2034-02-19	2035-02-07
52	Wood Rabbit	Gregarious, but aloof. Avoids confrontation. Benevolent, inclined to gossip. Artistic.	PEOPLE born in the year of the rabbit are the most fortunate. They are smooth talkers, talented and ambitious. Virtuous and reserved, they have exceedingly fine tastes, and other people regard them with admiration and deeply trust them. Rabbit people are always financially lucky. They have a fondness for mild gossip, but they are tactful and do not speak out willingly if they have to say something bad about someone. They are very affectionate to those they love but are curiously detached from their families, regarding the other members as little better than strangers. Rabbit people have to be goaded for quite a while before they lose their tempers, for by temperament they are placid. They are very clever at business, and if someone signs a contract with a rabbit person, there can be no backing out of it. Rabbit people are temperamentally melancholy and are able to weep at the slightest provocation. They are somewhat pedantic and not very well informed, so that, although what they know they know well, they will not seek out further information on other subjects. Rabbit people would make good gamblers, for they have the uncanny gift of picking the sure thing. They are a bit conservative and do not plunge into anything without first thinking it over carefully. Some Japanese regard rabbits with suspicion, for there is a belief that witches sometimes take the form of a rabbit. Rabbit people will have a placid existence throughout all three phases of their lives, provided they do not become involved with unmanageable elements. Rabbit people would do well to marry persons born in either the sheep, the boar, or the dog year. A bad marriage would be with someone born in the dragon year, and the worst would be with someone from either the rat or the rooster year.

53	Fire Dragon	Exotic. vital. Elegant, fond of the occult. Decisive, but not methodical. Over-confident, transient.	DRAGON-year people are healthy and energetic and at the same time excitable, short-tempered, and terribly stubborn. These are, of course, typical attributes for the dragon-year person. However, dragon-year people are honest, sensitive, and brave and can inspire trust in almost everyone. They are the most eccentric of any in the cycle. They don't like to borrow money, or to make complimentary or flowery speeches. Yet they are sincere in what they say, and their opinions are valid. They are capable of doing good work and devoting themselves to good works. But they can be just as strong in devoting themselves to evil. They are quite softhearted and are taken in by any sort of line. This gives other people tremendous advantage over them. Dragon people worry a great deal, and for no good reason. They are not prone to marry early, and in some cases not at all. This may account for their loneliness in their old age. Yet other people love them. Dragon-born people are somewhat fastidious. This makes it rather difficult for them in the first phase of their life. During the second phase, their fortunes will be like waves, and in the final phase, they will at last have peace and contentment. Dragon people do have big mouths and, when excited, say a great deal they don't mean, but normally they are not gossipers. Men born in the dragon year are also considered fortunate, for the dragon represents the greatest celestial power and is one of the two most beneficial astrological influences. The dragon symbolizes life and growth and is said to bring the five blessings: riches, harmony, virtue, longevity, and finishing the allotted life span. The best marriage for the dragon-year person would be with a person born in the year of the rat, snake, monkey, or rooster. Next best would be one born in the tiger, horse, sheep, or boar year. A bad marriage would be with one born in the ox, rabbit, or dragon year. The worst would be with one born in the year of the dog.

54	Fire Snake	Regarded as wise, but inwardly naive. Prudent, easily scandalized. Possessive.	PEOPLE born in this year, the year of the snake, are deep. They speak very little and possess tremendous wisdom. They are unbelievably fortunate in money matters in that they never have to worry about them. They will always be able to obtain money whenever they need it. Snake-year people are quite vain and always dress up to the point of foppery. They are selfish and just a bit stingy when they are approached for a loan. Yet people born in the snake year have tremendous sympathy for others and will try to help them, much to the annoyance of those they are helping, since snake-year people habitually overdo anything they do. This cannot be helped because snake people have doubts about other people's judgment and prefer to rely on their own accumulated wisdom. They are very determined in what they do and hate to fail at anything, and although they are calm by nature, they are most intense; if they shoot an arrow at a target, they must hit that target. People born in the snake year are quite passionate and are handsome if they are men and beauties if they are women. A compliment to a Japanese woman is to tell her that she is a mi-bijin, which means a snake-year beauty. However, people born in the snake year will always have marital troubles, for snake-year spouses have affections outside of the family. If they were to confine such affection to their immediate family, their lives would be much smoother. Great care must be taken in the third phase of a snake-year person's life, for it is the last phase that is the worst. Snake-year people would be wise to marry anyone born in either the ox or the rooster year. The next best marriage for them would be with those born in either the rat, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, or dog year. A bad marriage would be with someone born in the monkey year, and the worst would be with a person born in either the tiger or the boar year.

55	Earth Horse	Sociable, prejudiced, selfish, intolerant. Fond of sport and travel.	HORSE-YEAR people are very skillful in paying compliments and are quite popular. They are very cheerful people, but they talk too much. They are also very skillful with money and handle finances well. They are quick in everything they do and are able to grasp other people's meanings even before these people have a chance to think out what they want to say. They an. wise and talented and are good with their hands. Horse-year people are very decorative and showy in dress and manner. Although clever-looking, appearing as though they will never lose at anything they do, inside they are rather weak, especially toward members of the other sex; and if they are involved, whatever project they might be working on, they will fail at it. Horse-year people are not noted for their patience. They are hot-blooded, but in their everyday work they can be dispassionate over what they do. In their affections they are stimulated almost to the point of being blind to everything else. Horse-year people like theatrical entertainment and always go to plays and musicals, conventions, operas-almost any place where there are entertainers and large crowds. Horse people anger quickly, and by showing their anger they lose whatever confidence people may have had in them. They are terribly independent. They will not listen to advice, and as soon as they are able, they must strike out on their own, breaking away from family influence. During the first and second phases of their life, horse people will have much trouble, but during the third phase they will have a good life. Tiger-year, dog-year, and sheep-year people would make the best marriage for those born in the horse year. The next best would be those born in either the dragon, snake, monkey, rooster, or boar year. A bad marriage for horse people would be a marriage to people born in the year of the ox, rabbit, or horse. The worst marriage would be with one born in the rat year.	Yang	7	55	Gemini	3	128-horse.png	Horse	1978-02-07	1979-01-27	2038-02-04	2039-01-23
56	Earth Sheep	Fastidious, conservative, methodical. Dislikes disorder, but does not always have a method.	ELEGANT, highly accomplished in the arts, passionate by nature, a person born in the sheep year would, at first glance, seem to be better off than people born in the zodiac's other years. It is not so. For people born in the year of the sheep are shy, pessimistic, puzzled about life, and uncertain over what direction they should take. Deeply religious and timid by nature-timid to the point of a woman's timidity-they are never the world's conquerors or leaders. They are clumsy in speech and make poor salesmen, yet they are passionate in whatever they do and whatever they believe in, and not just in their affections either. Because they are uncertain about themselves and what they should do, sheep people must be guided, and in this case they will be best at the arts. Throughout their whole life, people born in the sheep year will never have problems over i-shoku-ju (having clothes, a good table, and comfortable living), for their abilities will always make money for them so that they will always be able to exercise their good taste. Wise and gentle in their ways, sheep people are easily stimulated to pity for those who are unfortunate. They are the sort of people who, upon hearing of a family that is destitute, will leave packages of food at their door or anonymously send them money, expecting no thanks and not wanting any. They would be too embarrassed to receive thanks. People born in the sheep year will have love and emotional problems during the second phase of their life, but during the third phase they will have extreme good fortune. The best marriage for a sheep-year person would be with either a rabbit-year person, a boar-year person, or a person born in the year of the horse. Next best would be one born in the year of the tiger, dragon, snake, sheep, monkey, or rooster. A bad marriage would be with one born in the rat year, and the worst would be with one born in either the ox or the dog year.

57	Metal Monkey	Audacious, insecure. Hyperactive, manic-depressive. Resents not being taken seriously. Inventive and agile. 	PEOPLE born in the year of the monkey are the erratic geniuses of the cycle. Clever and skillful in grand-scale operations, they are adroit when making financial deals. They are surprisingly inventive and original and are able to solve the most difficult problems with astonishing ease. There are few fields in which a person born in this year would not be successful. Monkey-year people have a disconcerting habit of agreeing with others. They feel more comfortable when they agree, but this sort of agreement is merely a policy tactic. If a monkey-year person sets out to do something and is unable to start immediately, he becomes discouraged and abandons the project even before he has actually tried it. Monkey people have a poor opinion of other people and tend to hold them in contempt. Yet monkey people are prized for their skills, talents, and flexibility. They are good at making decisions and have common-sense practicality. They are fired with a deep desire for knowledge, and they read, see, and know a great deal. They have good memories and can recall fine points and details with ease. They are also passionate and strong-natured, but they tend to cool off quickly. They become famous if they are allowed to pursue their own course. Monkey people, for all their negative qualities, are needed for their skills. The second phase in the monkey person's life is the worst, for he will be distracted and confused, and plans will go awry. The monkey-year man's relations with women will not be good. Monkey-year people must also be careful about over explaining, for by talking too much they will drive people away. The best marriage partner for monkey people would be someone born in the dragon or the rat year. The next best would be a person born in the year of the rabbit, sheep, or dog. A bad marriage would be one with a snake.:.year or a boar-year person, and the worst would be with someone born in the tiger year.

58	Metal Rooster	Alert, punctual. Frank, abrasive, competitive. Shrewd and precise; extravagant.	"ROOSTER-YEAR people are deep thinkers. They are always busy and devoted to their work. They always want to do more than they are able, and if they undertake a task beyond their abilities, they are disappointed when they discover they are unable to fulfill their obligation. People born in this year are eccentric, and it is this eccentricity that prevents them from having what is known in Japan as a ""roundness"" in their relationships with others. rooster people always think that they are right and that they know what they are doing. They do not trust other people and prefer to do what they like, alone. Their outward attitude and presentation is that of an adventuresome spirit, but inwardly they have little gift for high adventure and are filled with nonsensical plans that never mature. Although they are ambitious, for all their deep thinking they are not far-seeing and are somewhat improvident, for their fortunes resemble waves: sometimes they are wealthy, sometimes not. They are selfish and unheeding of other people's feelings and have a habit of speaking out directly whenever they have something on their minds. They are not at all shy and are quite brave when the occasion calls for it. Other people find rooster people interesting, but unless they are careful, rooster people will lose the good opinion of others. The best marriage for this sort of person is with either ox-year, snake-year, or dragon-year people. The next best would be with someone born In the year of the tiger, horse, sheep, monkey, or boar. A bad marriage would be with someone born in the rat year, rooster year, or dog year. The worst marriage would be with someone born in the year of the rabbit."

59	Water Dog	Honest, friendly, protective and defensive. Sociable, loyal to friends, reliable.	ALL the fine traits of human nature are in the possession of people born in the year of the dog. They have a deep sense of duty and loyalty, are extremely honest, and always do their best in their relationships with people. Dog-year people inspire other people's confidence and know how to keep private secrets absolutely private. Other people hold dog-year people in high regard and consider them fine persons. Yet dog-year people are somewhat selfish, terribly stubborn, and exceedingly eccentric. They care little for wealth yet always seem to manage to obtain money when they need it. They are not good at social gatherings, and emotionally they are cold. If there is any worst trait about these people it is their ability to find fault with things and their caustic remarks criticizing what they think wrong. They have terribly sharp tongues. It will be noted that throughout history it has always been a person who was born in the year of the dog who has been the champion of justice. Goaded by whatever injustice he may see, a dog-year person will not rest until right has been established. Eccentric as he is, he does not champion stupid causes, which is a good thing after all, for when a dog-year person takes up a cause he generally sees it through, and the side he takes up wins. Dog people are not noted for small talk, yet they make good leaders in industry. They are able to handle people when it is necessary, and trading firms or big business firms would be wise to hire such people for their industriousness and honesty. Surprisingly, for all the dog-year person's cool temperament, marriage with either horse-year, tiger-year, or rabbit-year people would be best. Next best would be marriage with a person born in the year of the rat, snake, monkey, dog, or boar. A bad marriage would be one with someone born in the year of the ox or the year of the rooster. The worst would be with someone born in either the dragon year or the sheep year.	Yang	11	59	Libra	5	128-dog.png	Dog	1982-01-25	1983-02-12	2042-01-22	2043-02-09
60	Water Boar	Content, home and family loving. Practical, acquisitive, industrious.	CHIVALROUS and gallant, people born in the year of the boar are always flying the white banner of purity. Whatever their ambition, they do what they must with all the strength they have, for their strength is an inner strength that no one can overcome. There is neither left nor right nor retreat when a boar person sets out to do something. He has tremendous fortitude and great honesty. Boar-year people don't make many friends, but when they do, they make friends for life, and anyone having a boar-year-born person as a friend is indeed fortunate. Boar-year people don't talk much, but when they finally say something, they let it all come out at one time, and there is no shutting them up until they have finished. Like monkey-year people, they have a great thirst for knowledge. They study a great deal and on the surface are generally well informed. However, if a boar person's knowledge is probed, it will be discovered that what he knows is limited. The Japanese saying is that such a person is broad in front but has a narrow back. Boar people are quite short-tempered, yet they hate quarreling or arguments. They are affectionate and kind to their loved ones. Boar people will have marital problems, and during the first and second phases of their lives they will have difficulties. Yet no matter how difficult their problems may be, boar people are shy and will not ask for outside help hut will seek solutions to their problems by themselves. Boar people are advised not to get into lawsuits, for, being impulsive and honest, they will lose the suit to someone who is unscrupulous. Rabbit and sheep people make the best spouses for those born in the year of the boar. The next best choice of a spouse would be any of those born in the rat, ox, tiger, dragon, horse, rooster, or dog year. A bad marriage would be with one born in either the monkey or the boar year, and the worst person to marry would be someone born in the year of the snake.
