People born under Aries are usually very executive, They accomplish earnest, and determined. what they resolve to do against all opposition. They are leaders, and naturally dominate those about them. They are noble, generous, magnetic, progressive, and have occult power and metaphysical tastes. They are good scholars, are bright, genial, witty, and great talkers. They can always lead the conversation into new and interesting paths, and are never at a loss to provide entertainment. The genius of this sign is intuition, and silent electro-magnetic power by means of the hands. These people are large and true, but are apt to be children of caprice, which has a sad effect upon their destiny. They reach their highest attainment through knowledge and the regenerative love-action of the heart. They love beauty, order, harmony, and elegant surroundings. They should not be circumscribed when giving out their true work of genius. If these people are born when the Sun is well centred in Aries, they may attain the rhythmic swing of their regenerative centres, and there arises an electro-magnetic solar fluid which is so powerful that it can be cast to a great distance; in fact, there is only one other sign so strong in this direction, and that is Aquarius.",Fire,Cardinal,Mars,1,21/3,20/4,/assets/west/aries_s.svg,https://placehold.jp/150x150.png

Those born under it are fearless and kinds, and very magnanimous when not irritated. They are generous, and apt to load themselves with the burdens and sorrows of others. Money has no special value in their minds except for the good it will do. They have no wish to hoard, and are always ready to divide. They prefer to help with money rather than by the expenditure of time or sympathy. They have great power of concentration, and make the best metaphysical healers. By the power of their will they can project their thought to great distances and hit the mark. They are exceedingly fond of the good things of the earth, and like to spread feasts for their friends.

NULL,Gemini,Twins,"Quick-Wittedness, Versatility, Perspicacity, Performance, Flexibility, Dexterity, Impatience, Self-Deception, Glibness, Superficiality, Inconstancy, Indecisiveness","MANY Gemini persons may be said to be double. One trait of character seems to con

They contradict another trait-in other words, they have a dual nature in active operation. want to travel, and they want to stay at home. They wish to study, and they wish to play. They are happy and unhappy, satisfied and dissatisfied at the same time. They are in love and not in love; warm and cold in one breath. The Gemini people do not fly quite so high as the other denizens of the Air Triplicity, because the twins are not always agreed upon the destination. This contradiction causes a state of nervousness which is very hard to overcome. Gemini people are extremely affectionate and generous, very courteous and kind to all. They are proud of birth, and have a great deal of family pride. They are not a selfish or a penurious people. They are thoughtful of the poor, and very sympathetic with the suffering. They are fond of the arts and sciences, are great readers and good talkers, and very quick to see the point of a story or joke. These people are not usually successful wage-earners, and frequently give away as fast as they can earn.",Air,Mutable,Mercury,3,22/5,21/6,/assets/west/gemini_s.svg,https://placehold.jp/150x150.png
NULL,Cancer,Crab,"Imagination, Affection, Insight, Caring, Tenacity, Caution, Avarice, Possessiveness, Irritability, Moodiness, Despondency, Hypersensitivity","THIS sign is called the paradox of the twelve. A few harmonious people are to be found in it, who as far as known have not given any especial attention to mental or spiritual development; but, generally speaking, the genius of the Cancer sign is exceedingly difficult to explain. Those born under it have a persistent will, a clutch of determination, intuition, and purpose.

Yet they often let go for a slight reason, or for no apparent reason. They are invincible to argument, and cannot be talked out of a thing; but if their feelings are hurt, they are apt to lose heart, and abandon whatever they have undertaken. Their great sensitiveness leads them into the most absurd extremes. They are as strong as giants and as weak as infants. These people are fond of travel, often taking long voyages, which are not always successful.

Those born under Cancer will be gifted in many directions far above the average, if educated thoroughly. They have a very superior intelligence, and an aptitude for learning new things and working out new principles. They are generous and full of sympathy for the public good, but they demand a full independence to develop the same. They are often capricious, and frequently change their occupation.",Water,Cardinal,Moon,4,22/6,23/7,/assets/west/cancer_s.svg,https://placehold.jp/150x150.png

They make good nurses when in full sympathy with the patient. They are emotional, very intuitive, and are generally able by means of this power to escape the consequences of their actions. Leo people are fine conversationalists, excelling in repartee, and are the best of story-tellers. They always make a point, and always see the point.
When the true individuality of Leo holds sway, these people have a noble ideal, with a loyal love, confident, pure, and abundant. Having minds of the practical, philosophical, and spiritual combinedâ€”a triunity-they radiate a luminous substance, which makes them a most powerful people for good, with a marked ability to inspire others.
Under such conditions they have the most remarkable power in moulding public opinion, and in swaying great audiences. In fact, the truly awakened Leo men and women are invincible if they will learn the pathway of silence.",Fire,Fixed,Sun,5,24/7,23/8,/assets/west/leo_s.svg,https://placehold.jp/150x150.png
NULL,Virgo,Maiden,"Luicity, Practicality, Discrimination, Service, Courtsey, Decorum, Nit-Picking, Meticulousness, Negativism, Crankiness, Snobbery, Reserve","THIS sign represents the hidden fire of the earth. People born under it are very orderly and methodical, and are good magnetic healers. Their hands seem charged with curative power. They are generous, and very solicitous about other people's affairs. They are usually much interested in the love matters of their friends, and have little hesitation in making or breaking matches. They are fine scholars, and make inspirational musicians. They keep their own secrets, and guard the secrets of their friends with equal fidelity. They are capable and efficient in all they undertake, being excellent planners and designers. The women are particularly fastidious about their dress, and like to lead the fashion. They are affectionate and devoted in the family, and are strong believers in blue blood. They aspire to the best things, but are easily discouraged in their climbing. These people are natural philosophers, and possess the most accurate intellectual discrimination of the whole twelve signs of the Zodiac. They are capable of reaching great heights as writers, public speakers, and musicians; they are natural chemists, and often excel as newspaper editors, from their knowledge of the reading public. They rebound quickly from defeat or disaster, because having great endurance and aptitude they can surmount almost every difficulty. As proofreaders they are exceedingly accurate. Their natural impulses are materialistic, and their deductions are usually drawn from the external, material side of things. Once they cross the threshold of the spiritual domain, they make rapid headway, and soon comprehend the principles of soul and spirit, becoming true teachers of the philosophy of human life and the immortality of the soul. The sense of feeling and touch is very accurate in these people, and by practice and drilling they quickly develop rare psychometric gifts. With proper training, these Virgo people may grow into the most powerful spiritual physicians. When entirely on the intellectual plane, they are crucial in their criticisms, and often become arbitrary and selfish, expecting perfection. Order and harmony are very necessary to their health. Food will not do them much good if anger and strife abound.",Earth,Mutable,Mercury,6,24/8,23/9,/assets/west/virgo_s.svg,https://placehold.jp/150x150.png
NULL,Libra,Scales,"Justice, Gentility, Aesthetics, Equilibrium, Charm, Idealism, Quarrelsomness, self-Indulgence, Manipulation, Indecision, Procastination, Talkativeness","PEOPLE born under this sign are energetic, ambitious, generous, and inspired. The men and women are said to differ even more than Leo men and women, and probably from the same reason. The Libra men having had to seek their own way, and to find their own companions and occupations, early learn to turn their inspirations and their clairvoyant ability to financial account, and so become stock brokers and sometimes gamblers. The scales of Libra tip very easily, and too often one scale touches bottom with a dead weight, while the other swings aloft unused and empty. Libra men are very fascinating, and they are as reckless in following out the gratification of their desires as they are in gambling games and speculations. This pursuit is not so much sensual as sensuous, and is more of an eagerness for new objects of attraction than an impulse of passion. When overtaken by disaster, they recover quickly and go to work again with redoubled vigor. Their feet never touch the earth in their calculations and intrigues. They are full of hope and enthusiasm, and crash after crash produces no effect. The Libra women who have not had the masculine liberty are not so reckless as their brothers. They are apt to be careless about money matters, and this is often due to their extreme aversion to the financial part of any transaction. They detest to be mixed up with money matters. They are not intentionally dishonest, for they always expect to be able to pay their debts, and often borrow with the noblest intentions, but if anything occurs to thwart their calculations-and ten to one it does-they expect the person borrowed from to be as magnanimous in forgiving the debt as they would be in paying it if they had the money. And yet these people, both men and women, have a keen and beautiful sense of justice; they are also exceedingly intuitive and mediumistic. When spiritualized, the scales hang evenly balanced, and the work that can be accomplished for humanity by the Libra people cannot be overestimated. Among them are poets, writers, and musicians. They soar high because the most rarefied air is their native element. They will give away the largest half of anything they possess, and never expect an equivalent.",Air,Cardinal,Venus,7,24/9,23/10,/assets/west/libra_s.svg,https://placehold.jp/150x150.png
NULL,Scorpio,Scorpion,"Dedication, Inspiration, Sovereignty, Tenderness, Magnetism, Discipline, Mercilessness, Sadism, Fanaticism, Suspicion, Revenge, Intransigence","THESE people are allied to the great powers of the ocean of this planet, and are possessed of a wonderful vibratory force, which gives them a great vitality through electro-magnetic influences. So marked is this power that they are able to benefit all who are closely connected with them. Their personal presence is a healing. They possess indomitable will and selfcontrol, and remarkable skill in the use of their hands. Their touch is so firm and delicate, their observation so keen, their poise so perfect, that they make the best surgeons in the world. They are not moved by the complaints or fears of their patients, and preserve the coolness of their native element under all circumstances, however trying. Such persons are often considered unfeeling and unsympathetic, and this is sometimes true, though more frequently is an appearance caused by a resolute and unflinching determination to succeed. fore an operation some of these surgeons are regarded by their patients as demons. Afterwards they are always gods.

The genius of eloquence is sometimes a direct inheritance of those born under this sign. They are powerful and magnetic public speakers, and when the spiritual nature is aroused they make the most popular and convincing clergymen. They have great tact and taste in the choice of language, and are usually very well aware of their influence over those with whom they come in contact.",Water,Fixed,"Pluto, Mars",8,24/10,22/11,/assets/west/scorpio_s.svg,https://placehold.jp/150x150.png
NULL,Sagittarius,Archer,"Optimism, Valor, Generosity, Honor, Solicitude, Reason, Outspokenness, Vacillation, Recklessness, Carelessness, Bad Manners, Contradiction","THE people born under this sign usually aim well and hit the mark in all matters.

Because of this characteristic they are prophetic, and can tell the outcome of almost any enterprise from its inception. They rarely make mistakes when they follow their own inspirations, but are sure to be led astray if they rely upon the advice of others. Sagittarius people are born busy, and keep busy under all circumstances. They are distinguished for minding their own business and keeping their own secrets. They do not trouble their neighbors' affairs, but are exceedingly active in their own. They always want to finish one thing before they begin another, and are as remarkable for their carefulness in detail as are the Aries people for carelessness or inability. These people are enterprising, progressive, and far-seeing, always courageous in an emergency, but frequently timid and afraid when there is no need for action or quick thought. An emergency is an inspiration. They are neat and orderly, and very careful in money matters, saving, but not penurious. It is seldom that you find a Sagittarius man or woman without money.  Their talents are varied, and they can earn a dollar while others are deploring the need of one. The women are fine housekeepers, excellent wives, and usually judicious mothers. They have a great love for children and animals. This is also a musical sign, and an occult sign, as those under its influence naturally turn to the spiritual side of life and make the most useful teachers.",Fire,Mutable,Jupiter,9,23/11,21/12,/assets/west/sagittarius_s.svg,https://placehold.jp/150x150.png

People born under it are deep thinkers, natural orators, and teachers. They are worshippers of intellect, and devotees to book knowledge. They are insatiable in their desire for intellectual growth. They are indefatigable workers, and apt to tire quickly because they usually do several things at a time. Like the goat, they will work for themselves without stop or stint, but are very restless when harnessed to work for others. They are not overstocked with self-esteem, and are apt to be self-conscious. Capricorn people resent all interference, and never meddle with the affairs of others. They are fine entertainers, have excellent memories, and excel in story telling. This is the most brilliant and the most depressed sign in the Zodiac. When jolly, these Capricorners are very jolly; when miserable, they are more miserable than all the others put together, and can usually give no adequate reason for their wretchedness. They are kind-hearted, loyal, secretive. A friend once is a friend always. They are usually careful in all money and business affairs, and a promise is sacredly regarded. They are natural planners, and know how to make both ends meet.",Earth,Cardinal,Saturn,10,22/12,20/1,/assets/west/capricorn_s.svg,https://placehold.jp/150x150.png
NULL,Aquarius,Water-bearer,"Vision, Tolerance, Originality, Independence, Charity, Individuality, Eccentricity, Disobedience, Seperateness, Thoughtlessness, Neurosis, Cruelty","PEOPLE born under this sign are said to be the strongest and the weakest people in the world. They are naturally endowed with great possibilities, which, when understood and appreciated, take them to supreme heights of strength and usefulness, and when ignored or unrecognized, cause them to be creatures of impulse and fluctuating desire, positively without equilibrium and blown about by every wind of doctrine. In the latter state they are those who constantly seek advice on the simplest subjects, and rarely ever take it; who ask questions with great humility and forget the answers. These persons are aware of possessing unusual power in certain directions, but they are so lazy and so deficient in the ability to concentrate, that these beautiful gifts are scattered and very frequently entirely lost.

Aquarius people are remarkable spiritual healers. Every human being born under this sign possesses this genius, whether he is aware of it or not, and it can be brought into a beautiful and phenomenal use by a respectful and loving recognition. To learn to know opportunity and improve it, is the key to Aquarius, genius.

The Aquarius women are not so timid and so apprehensive of danger to those they love as Libra women, or so restless and fidgety as Gemini women, but they usually care more for the acquisition of property than these people, and are apt to be very nervous about their investments, the management of business, and the opinion and speech of people.

They are natural lovers, and their realm is the kingdom of the soul. They rarely look for dishonesty; on the contrary, are prone to have too much confidence in the words and promises of those they love. They are very loyal to their friends, and will defend them whether right or wrong. It is almost impossible for the average Pisces person to acknowledge a flaw in the person cared for. These are the people who will deny themselves the absolute comforts of life to further the interests of relative or friend. These are also the people of quick attractions and equally quick repulsions, though they are generally too kind to let their aversions be seen. They are very fond of beautiful things in nature and art, and among them are to be found excellent art critics, artists, and writers. They have a limpid purity of style when properly educated, that resembles the clear, blue, shimmering water which is their native element. When writing, they have always an eye to the placidly picturesque.",Water,Mutable,"Neptune, Jupiter",12,20/2,20/3,/assets/west/pisces_s.svg,https://placehold.jp/150x150.png
